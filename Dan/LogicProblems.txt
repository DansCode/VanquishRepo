##########Easy problems

1. Neither Oliver nor Blake like being in the air. There are two airborn activities,
but Abigail doesn't like rock climbing. So that leaves the other airborn activity for
Abigail, who likes ziplining. The other airborn activity then has to go to Rosa: rock
climbing. Then Oliver has to be the kayaker, since Blake wants his feet on the ground.
That makes Blake the cook.

2. Examining possibilities from the clues:
iteration 1:
Pepper = {burying}
Ginger = {scratch, catch, nap, burying}
Saber = {catch, nap, burying}
Bear = {catch, burying}
Nutmeg = {scratch, walk}

interation 2:
Pepper = {burying}
Ginger = {scratch, catch, nap}
Saber = {catch, nap}
Bear = {catch}
Nutmeg = {scratch, walk}

interation 3:
Pepper = {burying}
Ginger = {scratch}
Saber = {nap}
Bear = {catch}
Nutmeg = {scratch, walk}

interation 4:
Pepper = {burying}
Ginger = {scratch}
Saber = {nap}
Bear = {catch}
Nutmeg = {walk}


3. The clues give this order, taller people are rightward:

Delia - Weldon - Zina
Benito - Leisha - Delia - Weldon
{constraint that Benito is not shortest}

The only person left to slot as shortest is Charlotte. So from left to right, are the 
people from shortest to tallest:

Charlotte, Benito, Leisha, Delia, Weldon, Zina


#############Medium problems

1. From the clues, the 3 grads are {Stephanie, Elias, James} and the 3 dads are 
{Michael, Ken, Alberto}. Let's map dads to possible kids:

Michael = {Elias, James}
Ken = {Stephanie, Elias, James}
Alberto = {Elias, James}

Iteration 2: Michael and Elias are not related

Michael = {James}
Ken = {Stephanie}
Alberto = {Elias}

I tried but I'm not sure about this one.
