Easy Problem 1:


Who are the children: Oliver, Blake, Abigail, Rosa

Step 1:
    Check what each child cannot do
        -Oliver and Blake like being on the ground, therefore no rock climbing or ziplining
		-Abigail doesn't rock climb.

Step 2:
    Match based on what each child likes:
        -Rosa needs a harness, so we know she does an airborne activity. 
		-There are two airborne activities, assume rock climbing doesn’t need a harness so.that leaves ziplining to Abigail.

Step 3:
    Figure out all the remaining activites
        -Blake likes to be on the ground so cooking is best match
		-Oliver remaining therefore he has kayaking

So:
Abigail -> ziplining
Rosa -> rock climbing
Blake -> cooking
Oliver -> kayaking

==================

Easy Problem 2 : 

Step 1: 
What activities can they not do: 
	-Ginger/Saber/Bear are NOT on a walk 
	-Pepper is not getting it’s ear scratched, taking a nap, or going for a walk
Step 2
What activities are they potentially doing?:
	-Pepper is playing catch or burying a chew toy
	-Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper may be getting their ears scratched
	-Saber, Bear may be playing catch
	-Bear is getting some exercise 
Step 3
Based on what we know decide who is doing what:
        -Bear -> Playing catch since only other exercise and not spice
        -Pepper -> burying chew toy since bear is playing catch
        -Saber -> taking nap since not getting ear scratched and and not going for walk
        -Nutmeg -> is on a walk  since ginger can’t be on a walk
        -Ginger -> By process of elimination must be getting it’s ear scratched and has a spice name
    

Pepper  - buying a chew toy
Saber -  taking a nap 
Ginger -   Ears scratch
Nutmeg - On a walk
Bear - Catch 

=====================

Easy Problem 3:

There is six children: Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina

Step 1:
Constraints (what we know):
-Welden	-> taller than delia 
        -> Shorter than Zina

-Leisha	-> Taller than Benito
        ->Shorter than Delia & Weldon

-Benito	-> not the shortest

Step 2:

Visual representation: Sort by shortest to tallest based on given information

Delia < Weldon < Zina
Benito < Leisha < Delia

Use visuals to create a list.
Charlotte not mentioned, so assumed the shortest

Charlotte < Benito < Leisha < Delia < Weldon < Zina

===================

Medium Problem 1:

Who are the people?: Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, and Stephanie

Step 1:

What do we know?:
Three fathers
Three graduates

Stephanie -> Prom with Micheal’s Son
Elias & James -> Same basketball team -> One is son of Alberto
Micheal and Elias -> Not related

Step 2:
Who can be in a potential parent/graduate group?

-Micheal is a parent bc he has a son
-Stephanie -> Graduate b/c she went with son of Micheal to prom
-Alberto is parent as he has a son 
-Alberto’s son is Elias since Michael and Elias are not related

Known groups so far:
Fathers:
-Micheal 
-Alberto

Graduates:
-Stephanie
-James

-Since Elias and James are on the same basketball team, it can be assumed that Elias is a graduate

So by process of elimination and three of each group: ken is a father

Fathers:
-Micheal 
-Alberto
-Ken

Graduates:
-Stephanie
-James
-Elias

Step 3:
To match them together:
We know Alberto is Elias’ Father
We know Micheal has a son so James is his son
Stephanie and Ken are family since both are not paired with anyone else.

So:
Alberto -> Elias
Micheal -> James
Ken -> Stephanie


==============

Medium Problem 2:

Step 1:

What do we know?:
Seven Neighbours

Daniel -> Can’t see Benita’s house -> can see greta’s since in the way
Adam -> Directly across from Daniel
Benita -> Elena lives west of them
Elena -> Cross three streets to Franco’s home
Hal -> East of Benita

Step 2:
Can we come to a conclusion based on what we know?:
	-Benita has Elena and Hal living west and east respectively, 
	-Greta’s house is between Daniel’s and Benita’s
	-Adam lives across from Daniel
	-Franco lives three streets away from Elena


-But without knowing the location of the houses on a map, there is no definitive way to know the answer
-Where Charlie’s house can be is arbitrary since each neighbour can have large gaps between each house because the distance between each house is not stated outside of franco.
-There is also no information given on the location of Charlie's house relative to his neighbours further reinforcing the need of the diagram.


Therefore, this puzzle cannot be solved definitively.

Hard Problem 1

What do we know?:
3 have sugar in them, 1 has salt
Only one message is telling the truth

Takes each one message as true and the other three as false.

Step 1:
Assume A is true:
If A is true:
-A is Salt
-B is Sugar
-C is Salt

This is a contradiction since if A is true then C cannot be true. Only 1 Salt.

Step 2:
Assume B is true:
If B is true:
-A is sugar
-B is salt
-C is salt

This is a contradiction as there can only be one salt. B and C cannot be salt.

Step 3:
Assume C is true:
If C is true:
-A is sugar
-B is sugar
-C is sugar
-D says B has salt

This is a contradiction since if B has sugar it’s a false statement, D contradicts it.

Step 4:
Assume D is true:
If D is true:
-A is sugar
-B is sugar
-C is salt
-D says that B is sugar

All statements when D is true are consistent. Therefore C has the salt.
